          <h4>Why Flask?</h4>
          <p>
            Flask is small but powerful web framework with good community and documentation.
            It depends only on two external libraries and gets a lot of extensions. Flask is a good choice to start web development with Python.

          <h4>Why Raspberry Pi?</h4>
          <p>
